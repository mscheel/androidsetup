Hackathon?  Training Class?  Need an Android IDE setup quick and completely, you found your guide

I teach a lot of Android training classes, sometimes in places with poor WiFi.  I have witnessed a lot of student frustration when they realize they do not have everything they need to start coding.  Similar at hackathons. This guide aims to fix that.

# 0. Start on good Wifi with your computer well powered.  You are not done until you have launched an android application on an emulator.

# 1. Get the IDE

Android Studio, based on Intellij, can be downloaded from [d.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html), the latest from the stable channel is what you will get when you click the big green button.  Install the download.

Caution, you are not done yet!

# 2. Start your first project

Open Android Studio and create a project (File > New Project if you have previously installed Android Studio). Use all the default options, you do not need to understand them.  Eventually after clicking Finish you will see some code.  Sometimes you will have errors because libraries need to be updated.  This is good you since you are on nice Wifi, allow the IDE to make upgrades and do it's thing (eg click the suggested actions if you see them).

# 3. Create an emulator

You need a device to run your creation on, and while you can use your personal device, it is good practice to make an emulator.  The fastest way to do this is to run your recently created app by clicking the green play button at the top of the IDE.  If you do not have a device connected it will prompt you to create a local emulator.  It will need a large download for whatever version of Android you select to use.  Lucky for you you are on good Wifi.  

# 4. Run your app

Your emulator will need to start from scratch which can take a little bit, be patient.  Once your app launches you know you are done.

# 5. Celebrate and get ready to learn!

You have an exciting journey ahead of you
